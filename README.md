# Alfred Workflow CLI Utilities

Bash script utilities package to help developing Alfred workflows in command lines.


###Install
1. Download the package to a dedicated scripts folder. 
2. Make sure this folder has been added to `$PATH`.
3. Put `source /your/path/to/this/package/config.sh` in `.bashrc`, `.zshrc` or other shell config files to enable `cdwf` command.

###Command
* createwf -- create a new alfred workflow
	* Usage: `createwf workflow-name`
	* Description: 
		* A folder and an `info.plist` file will be generated for this new workflow in Alfred's directory system. This process is the same as `Alfred -> Workflows -> + -> Blank Workflow`.
		* Workflow's attributes, which are name / bundleid / author / readme / website, are based on `workflow-name` and default setting in `Alfred -> Workflows -> + -> Workflow Defaults...`.
		
* cdwf -- cd to the workflow folder
	* Usage: `cdwf [-c|-d] [workflow-name|bundle-id]`
	* Description: 
		* Changing folder to workflow directory based on `workflow-name` or `bundle-id`. If there is an `info.plist` file in current folder, this command will also bring you to the corresponding workflow directory. When workflow cannot be found, you will be brought to `~/Library/Application Support/Alfred 2/Alfred.alfredpreferences/workflows`.
		* **-c** Instead of workflow directory, changing directory to workflow cache folder under `~/Library/Caches/com.runningwithcrayons.Alfred-2/Workflow Data`
		* **-d** Instead of workflow directory, changing directory to workflow data folder under `~/Library/Application Support/Alfred 2/Workflow Data`.
		
* syncwf -- two way synchronization between current directory and workflow directory
	* Usage: `syncwf -gp [-f] [-o rsync-options] [workflow-name|bundle-id]`
	* Description: 
		* Update content between current and workflow directory with `rsync`
		* **-g** _(Get)_ Copy content from workflow directory to the current one.
		* **-p** _(Put)_ Copy content from current directory to the workflow one.
		* **-f** _(Force Mode)_ Synchronize without confirmation.
		* **-o** _(Options)_ Use these options for `rsync`. Defalut `rsync` options  are `-av --update --delete --exclude=.* --exclude-from=.gitignore`.
		* **-n** _(Dry run)_ Show what would have been transferred by `rsync`.
		* **[workflow-name|bundle-id]** Use `workflow-name`, `bundle-id` or `info.plist` file (if exists in current folder) to determine the path of workflow directory. Another way is to read path from pipeline directly, e.g. `echo $path_of_workflow_directory | syncwf`.
		
* findwf -- print the path to workflow based on `workflow-name`, `bundle-id` or `info.plist` (if exists in current folder)
	* Usage: `findwf [workflow-name or bundle-id]`
